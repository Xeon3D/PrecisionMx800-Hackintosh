First about display-cfg. It describes what type of screen is attached.

The last two bytes are made up as following:

If some condition (unknown yet, we thought it had to do with if a screen is attached to that output, which it had not) is met we get:

BYTE: Display-Number
BYTE: I2C Read Offset
BYTE: 0xFF
BYTE: 0xFF

If the unknown condition above is not met its build up as following regarding the type of screen attached.

For ANALOG:

BYTE: Display-Number
BYTE: I2C Read Offset
BYTE: 0xFF
BYTE: 0x00

For TV:

BYTE: Display-Number
BYTE: I2C Read Offset
BYTE: 0xFF
BYTE: 0x01

And for everything else like LVDS, TMDS and Display-Port

BYTE: Display-Number
BYTE: I2C Read Offset
BYTE: DCB Entry OR (guessing)
BYTE: 0x03

There is one display-cfg for each screen. Here an example (note we have to swap bytes to inject):

@0,display-cfg <03YYXX00>  XX = I2C Read Offset; YY = DCB ENTRY OR VALUE (guessing)
@1,display-cfg <03YYXX01>  XX = I2C Read Offset; YY = DCB ENTRY OR VALUE (guessing)
