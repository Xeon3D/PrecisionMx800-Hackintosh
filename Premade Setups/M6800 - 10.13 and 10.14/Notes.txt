Before you start Please note that :

I am using Dell Presision m6800 with these SPEC

        Intel I7 4900MQ - Intel HD Haswell 4600
        32 GB RAM 
        Nvidia Quadro K3100M 
        Samsung EVO 250 GB

BIOS A25 ( Latest 30 Oct 2018 )


This Process has been successfully tested with High Sierra and Mojave 10.14.5

                                    Step By Step

1- Reset BIOS to its default and Update it to A25 
2- Modify BIOS setting ( Press F12 to see Options ): 

                       * Advanced Boot Options = Enable Legacy
                       * Integrated NIC = Enable
                       * Parallel Ports = AT
                       * Seial Ports = Disabled ( If you are using Dock station then Enable it - Expermental )
                       * Sata Opeartion = AHCI 
                       * Drivers = Check all
                       * Switchable Graphics = Enable Switchable Graphics
                       * Secure Boot = Disabled 
                       * Virtualization = Disable 

3- Create your OSX Installation USB ( Search How , its not my Topic )
   * Then I recommend to install Clover bootlader to create EFI in your USB
4- Once you create installation USB ; mount USB EFI and DELETE EFI Folder
5- Decompress my attached files 
6- find ( install Folder ) ; Copy EFI and Paste it in your EFI PARTITION ( instead of deleted one in step 4)
7- Now you are ready to Install OSX for Dell Precision M6800 
                       * Power On your PC
                       * Press F12 to see Options 
                       * Select BOOT from ( your USB )
                       * Start Installation Process ( it will reboot several time during installation so press F12           
                         each time to boot from your USB )

8- Once installation done and you reach OSX desktop ; 
                       
                        * Mount your OSX EFI PARTITION and delete ( EFI Folder if existed )
                        * On my attached files Find ( Boot Disk EFI ); copy EFI and Paste it in your EFI  
                          PARTITION instead of deleted one

9- Now the last step ( very Important )

   - on my attached files Find ( L/E Folder ) 
   - use any method or tool to install ALL KEXTS to Library/Extensions 
   - Rebuild kextcache and repair permissions 


10- Reboot your PC and check everything is working correctly ( Audio , Bluetooth , WiFi , Internet , USB 3 ... )

IF you are using Mojave ; No Cuda drivers available till now but the Nvidia GPU works with External Monitor via DP Fully Accelerated Qi-Ci , also you can Disable Bios graphics Optimus to disable Intel HD GPU and use only Nvidia GPU - The same thing with High Sierra except that Nvidia Web Drivers are available and Cuda are ready 

If you face any issue with boot or GPU try to change config.plist SMBIOS to MacbookPro 10.1 or 11.2 or 13.1 and you can use iMac 14.2 as well


Have Fun
